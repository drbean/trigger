** identity-defining events

Sally, Henry and Debbie recall things that happened that triggered changes in the way they viewed themselves.

- A turning point for Sally was when she learned Spanish.
- She was envious of kids who could speak another language.
- When she learned Spanish, she found she was actually pretty good at it.
- When she reached the breakthrough stage--when she discovered she could actually communicate with people in the language--she was really proud of herself.
- Now she can speak three languages.
- Henry has a twin brother and they have always been very close.
- When he was 18, they went to different colleges.
- That was the first time they had had to cope on their own.
- Henry thinks it was good in a way, because they both became more confident and independent.
- He realized he was actually capable of working things out on his own.
- Debbie guesses she was always pretty shy.
- She didn't share a lot with people, not even with her parents.
- When she got a prize for being top student, she didn't think too much about it.
- But people suddenly started treating her differently.
- She thinks some of the kids in school started looking up to her.
- And she became a lot more outgoing after that.

** Alex, Yiyun regret not doing some things.

- Alex stopped exercising.
- He thinks it's the dumbest thing he ever did.
- He has been trying to lose weight for the last year and a half, but it's really difficult.
- He thought he would be thin forever and he ate junk food all the time.
- But after college, he quit playing sports.
- Now he is determined to join a gym, because he knows he can't get healthy by just dieting.
- If YiYun had had a choice, she would have learned to play the guitar.
- When she was a kid, her parents made her study piano.
- She loves the piano, but wishes she could bring a guitar to a party and have everyone sing songs.
- Jacob regrets not going to Europe with his friends when he had the choice.
- In the summer after he graduated, he started looking for a job, but his friends went backpacking in Europe for a few weeks.
- He thinks he should have gone because he didn't get a job right away and his friends had an unforgettable time together.
- He regrets it because they had an amazing experience without him and he could have gone.
